## Personal Learnings

While working on this project, I revisited and found several concepts interesting and important:

- **HTML and CSS Basics**: Reinforced the basics of structuring an HTML document and applying CSS styles.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Learned how to use JavaScript to interact with the DOM, including adding and removing classes to show and hide elements.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event listeners to handle user interactions with the gallery controls.
