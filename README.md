# Frontend Master Bootcamp: Gallery Project

## Introduction

This project is part 1 of the "Using JavaScript in Websites" course from the Frontend Masters Bootcamp. It focuses on creating an interactive image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was a great way to revisit the basics of JavaScript along with HTML and CSS.

In part 2, we implement Swiper and GSAP libraries to enhance this gallery. You can find Part 2 [here](https://github.com/tak40/fm-bootcamp-interactive-gallery2).

## Features

- **HTML and CSS**: Utilizes HTML for structure and CSS for styling the image gallery.
- **JavaScript**: Implements functionality to navigate through the gallery images using "Prev" and "Next" buttons.

## Personal Learnings

While working on this project, I revisited and found several concepts interesting and important:

- **HTML and CSS Basics**: Reinforced the basics of structuring an HTML document and applying CSS styles.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Learned how to use JavaScript to interact with the DOM, including adding and removing classes to show and hide elements.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event listeners to handle user interactions with the gallery controls.
